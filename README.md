# CPU-Predictor
Ths program takes a database of CPU information and matches the user's input to the most similar CPUs. It also predicts the CPU's Cinebench R20 Multithreaded score to gauge the user's CPU's performance. The data provided on Github is a mere sample meant to be used when testing out this program.

Thank you for using CPU Predictor by Fin Deevy!
